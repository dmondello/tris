Design Decisions
I design two version of tris without the Apis to be secure that the "core of application" was ok.
For both versions I use AI and not two player to be faster to test the game.
The games are (they are in the folder "versions_no_api":
  tris.py 
  tris.py it's a classic game with UI that user can launch from terminal and play the game.
  simplytris.py
  simplytris.py it's the same game without UI

Than I used the provided sample game of Guess-a-Number.
I decided to use a text for the board with 9 comma-seperated characters, where each character has to be a '-', 'X', or 'O'.
So i can image the board positions are the same in json.
- To realize a ranking, I calculate the win ratio.
The formula for every user calculates the total of number of wins minus number of losses.
In models.py I create a class RankingForm for outbound Ranking information with user_name, rank and net_win_ratio.

- The games don't give a visual information about the board but this is because i give this opportunity to who design the client.
